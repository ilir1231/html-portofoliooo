  <p>It was my first Office job and one thing which i founded tough from the beginning was the concept of the office job 
  U had to work as a team if u wanted to have succsess which i founded very tough to belive as a naive 18 years old. 
  Thats why i would find myself struggle as Call Agent and i always blamed it on others colleagues the work space the boss etc.. <br>
  Until i came to conclusion that i was problem but hey we all start somewhere </p>

<p>For me this job i have it very easy to say that to me it didnt feel like i job it felt like a honor 
   I was a caster for the first Valorant tournament in kosovo to you it may not sound a big deal but for a gaming enthusiastic it meant the world to me 
   Everyday i was with a smile on my face ready to give my best and the colleagues made it very easy for me while being there to every problem i had 
  so that was a great expirence for me which im very thankful </p>

  <p>My first coding enviroment my first real job as a"developer" the idea it felt fantastic the workspace was fantastic and the colleagues were amazing but there was one problem and that was me cause the people there were very kind amazing and helpful but my commitment was on all time low and i felt horrible cause i knew they wanted what was best for me and i want that too but at that time i was bamboozled
 by the money i recommend that amazing firm to everybody and i wish to go back there and prove myself and show what im worth but for now i got to get to  work.  </p>
